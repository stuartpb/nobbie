# Nobby

This was my on-device code for the [Misty Robotics][] [Bots, Brews, and BUILD Workshop][BBB].

The original idea was to set the seat the bot would deliver to by rotating the bot's right arm, then patting its head to send the beer. The code here contains the first half of that: the rest is left as an exercise for the reader (we never actually got as far as testing in the event itself).

The skill is named after [Nobby][LiftBot], the robot that controls the lifts by using its one arm to pull a lever selecting the floor on the [Starship Titanic][].
